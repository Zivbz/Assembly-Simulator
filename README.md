# Assembly simulator---final-project
Final project in "Systems programming" course - Assembly simulator 

The final assignment for this course was to create an Assembly simulator using the C programming language. The simulator simulates an Assembler's work. Files with Assembly orders are received, errors are checked, orders are processed, and actions are generated accordingly.

Most of the work involves developing testing functions and understanding the logic of an Assembler.
Furthermore, the assignment involved learning and understanding the C programming language, memory allocation, the use of pointers, and more.
